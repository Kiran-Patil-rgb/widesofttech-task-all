 * loops *
 loops in javascript control structures taht enable the repeated execution
 of a blck of code as long as a specified condition remains true.they are
 fundamental for automatinig repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of
 data.
  * types of loops *

   1> for loop: this loop is used when the number of iteration is known or can be determined
    beforehand.its synatax includes an intializaation expression,a condition,and an
    update expression, all executed in a specific order during each iteration.
    ex,
    for (let i=0; i< 5; i++){
        console.log("iteration:" + i);
    }  

    2>while loop: the while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified
    condition evaluates to true.the condition is checked before each iteration.
    ex,
    let count = 0;
    while(count < 3){
        console.log(count)
        count++;
    }

    3> d0..while loop:similar to the while loop,but the code block is executed at
    least once before the condition is evaluated.subsequent depend on the condition
    remaining true.
    ex,
    let num = 0;
    do{
        console.log(num);
        num++;
    } while (num < 0);
