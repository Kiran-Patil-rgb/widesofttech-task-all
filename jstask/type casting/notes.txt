*TYPECASTING*
Typecasting in JavaScript, more commonly referred to as type conversion or type coercion, is the process of transforming a value from one data type to another.
 This can occur either implicitly (automatically by the JavaScript engine) or explicitly (manually by the developer). 

  1> IMPLICIT TYPE CONVERSION:
  This occurs automatically when JavaScript performs an operation that requires a specific data type, and the provided value is of a different type.
   The engine attempts to convert the value to the expected type.

   Examples:
 1> Arithmetic operations with different types: ` "5" + 2 ` results in "52" (number converted to string for concatenation).
 2> Boolean contexts: ` if ("hello") ` evaluates to true because non-empty strings are implicitly converted to true in a boolean context.

 2> Explicit Type Conversion (Casting):
This involves deliberately converting a value using built-in functions or operators. This provides more control over the conversion process.
 * Common methods for explicit conversion:
 1> To Number:
 * Number(value): Converts value to a number. Returns NaN if the conversion is not possible.
 * parseInt(string, radix): Parses a string and returns an integer.
 * parseFloat(string): Parses a string and returns a floating-point number.
 * Unary plus operator: +value attempts to convert value to a number.

 2>  To String:
 * String(value): Converts value to a string.
 * value.toString(): Method available on most data types to convert them to their string representation.

 3>  To Boolean:
 1> Boolean(value): Converts value to a boolean. Falsy values (e.g., 0, "", null, undefined, NaN) become false, while all other values become true.

 *  Key differences: 
 1> Clarity:
 Explicit statements are clear and direct, while implicit statements require interpretation. 
 2> Directness:
 Explicit communication is straightforward, whereas implicit communication relies on context and inference. 
 3> Consciousness:
 
 Explicit information is consciously understood, while implicit information may be subconscious.
