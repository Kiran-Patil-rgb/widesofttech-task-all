     *objects*
 * defination: in javascript, objects are fundamental data structure used to stror collection of related data and functionality,
 they are non-primitive data type, meaning they are refernce values rather than primitives values like numbers,string, or bolleans.

  * key characteristics of objects:
  1> key-value pairs : objects store data in the form of key-value pairs, often referred to as properties.each property has a unique "key" 
   that identifies it, and an associated "value" which can be any javascript data type, including other objects,
   arrays,function, or primitives values.

  2> methods: when a property's value is a function, it is known as a methodMethods represent actions or behaviors that the object can perform. 
  
  3> dynamic nature: objects are dynamic, allowing properties to be added,modifiied,or deleted at runtime.

 * creation:
  objects can be created using:
  1> object literals: the most commmon and concise way,using curly braces {} to define properties directly.
  2> object constructors: using the new object() constructor or custom constructor functions.

  * accessing properties:
  properties are accessed using:
  1> dot notation: objectname.propertyname(prefferd for simple property names).
  2> bracket notation: objectname['propertyname'](useful for property names with special characters or when the property name is stored in variable).

  syntax:
  let object = {
    key : value,
    key1 : value1,
    key2 : value2,
    key3 : value3,
    .
    .
    .
    keyFunction: ()=>{console.log()}
}
