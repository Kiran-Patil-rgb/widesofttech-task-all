  * OUTPUT METHOD *
   1> console.log(): This is the most common method for debugging and displaying information in the browser's developer console.
    It is useful for checking variable values, tracking code execution, and observing program flow during development.
    EX,
    console.log("Hello, Console!");
    let data = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
    console.log("User data:", data);

    2> document.write(): This method writes content directly into the HTML document. 
    While functional, using it after the page has fully loaded can overwrite the entire document content, making it less suitable for dynamic updates.
    EX,
    document.write("<h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>");

    3> alert(): This method displays a modal alert dialog box with a specified message and an "OK" button.
     It is primarily used for providing user notifications or simple messages that require immediate attention.
     EX,
     alert("This is an important message!");

     * INPUT METHOD *
     1> prompt(): This method displays a modal dialog box that prompts the user for input and returns the entered value as a string.
      It includes an input field and "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.

      2> HTML Form Elements: User input is most commonly obtained through HTML form elements like <input>, <textarea>, and <select>.
       JavaScript interacts with these elements by accessing their value property or listening for events like change or submit.

       3> confirm(): confirming user input typically refers to using the confirm() method, which displays a dialog box with a message and two buttons: "OK" and "Cancel." 
       This method is commonly used to ask for user confirmation before proceeding with an action.
       syntax:let isConfirmed = confirm(message);

        * Parameters:
    1> message: An optional string that will be displayed in the confirmation dialog box.

   * Return Value:
  1> true: If the user clicks the "OK" button.
  2> false: If the user clicks the "Cancel" button.
 EX,
  let userDecision = confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this item?");

if (userDecision) {
  // User clicked OK, proceed with deletion
  console.log("Item deleted successfully.");
} else {
  // User clicked Cancel, do not delete
  console.log("Deletion canceled.");
}
