  * conditional statements *
  * Conditional statements in JavaScript allow for the execution of different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. 
  They are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program and enabling decision-making.

  * types of conditional statements *
   1> if statement: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
   ex,
   let age = 20;
    if (age >= 18) {
        console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
    }
   2> else statement: Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition in the preceding if statement is false. 
   ex,
   let temperature = 25;
    if (temperature > 30) {
        console.log("It's hot outside.");
    } else {
        console.log("It's not too hot.");
    }
   3> else if statement: Allows for checking multiple conditions sequentially.
    If the initial if condition is false, 
    subsequent else if conditions are evaluated until one is true, or the final else (if present) is executed.
    ex,
    let score = 75;
    if (score >= 90) {
        console.log("Grade: A");
    } else if (score >= 80) {
        console.log("Grade: B");
    } else if (score >= 70) {
        console.log("Grade: C");
    } else {
        console.log("Grade: F");
    }
   4> switch statement: Evaluates an expression and executes the case statement that matches the expression's value.
    It provides a more structured way to handle multiple possible values for a single expression compared to chained else if statements.
    ex,
    let day = "Monday";
    switch (day) {
        case "Monday":
            console.log("Start of the week.");
            break;
        case "Friday":
            console.log("End of the work week!");
            break;
        default:
            console.log("Just another day.");
    }

   *  The break statement is crucial within switch cases to prevent "fall-through" to subsequent cases. 
   The default case is optional and executes if no other case matches.
