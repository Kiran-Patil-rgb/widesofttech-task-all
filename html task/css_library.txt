  * CSS LIBRARY *
  defination:
  * A CSS library, often referred to as a CSS framework, is a pre-written collection of CSS code and styles designed to streamline and accelerate web development.
   These libraries provide developers with a structured foundation and reusable components, eliminating the need to write all CSS from scratch for every project.
  *  Key characteristics and benefits of CSS libraries:
  1> Pre-built components:
  They offer ready-to-use styles for common UI elements like buttons, forms, navigation menus, and typography, promoting consistency and reducing development time.

  2> Grid systems:
  Many frameworks include responsive grid systems, simplifying the creation of adaptable layouts that work seamlessly across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

  3> Responsiveness:
  They often incorporate built-in utilities and approaches for mobile-first design, ensuring websites and applications are responsive by default.

  4> Efficiency and consistency:
  By providing a standardized set of styles and design patterns, CSS libraries help maintain a consistent visual identity throughout a project and improve development efficiency.

  5> Reduced boilerplate code:
  Developers can leverage pre-defined classes and rules, significantly reducing the amount of CSS they need to write manually.

  6> Customization:
  While offering a foundational structure, most CSS libraries allow for extensive customization of styles, themes, and layouts to meet specific project requirements.

   * Examples of popular CSS libraries/frameworks include:
   Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Bulma, and Material UI (often used with React)
